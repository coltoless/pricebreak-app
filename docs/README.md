## How to Generate Documentation

Use the Cursor AI commands in the `.cursor/commands/` directory:

1. **Product Brief**: `@create_brief.md` in Cursor AI chat
2. **Feature Planning**: `@plan_feature.md` in Cursor AI chat  
3. **Code Review**: `@code_review.md` in Cursor AI chat
4. **Documentation**: `@write_docs.md` in Cursor AI chat

## Example Usage

To create a product brief for PriceBreak:

```
@create_brief.md

We are building PriceBreak, an AI-powered flight search application for destination wedding guests. It aggregates flight data from multiple airlines, provides price alerts, and includes auto-buy functionality to help guests find the best flight deals for wedding travel.
```

This will generate a `PRODUCT_BRIEF.md` file with the project context and requirements.
